# Simple Chat Server
This is piece of coursework I wrote for CM50275 Principles of Programming at the University of Bath.

## Overview
The Simple Chat Server is a socket-based terminal chat application to allow users to interact with their friends and colleagues. Once the server is running, many different clients can connect to interact with one another. An overview of the primary features are specified below:
- Asynchronous, real-time message sending.
- Broadcast-style and private messaging.
- Chat colours on ANSI-enabled terminals to improve readability.
- Chat-bot friendly! (I've included an example chat bot client in this repository.)

Here's a snapshot of the chat client doing it's magic!
